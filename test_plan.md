This test plan is for the 2048 game played through the command line. It may or may not be fulfilled by the current 2048 game.
Format is as follows:

	Test objective:
	Technique:

Aspects of the program to be tested:

User Interface Testing:

	Test objective: Verify the output of the 2048 game board is readable with many applicable configuration of numbers.	
	Technique: Start application. Verify readability of initial game board. Play game for 30 turns. During each turn, check game board for readability.
	Restart application. Move a tile to the 4 corners of the screen. Verify the tiles are readable. Move a tile to the four edges of the screen. Verify the tiles are readable. Create a tile with a 4 digit number, verify readable. Create a tile with 5 digit number, verify readable.
	

Performance Testing:

	Test objective: Verify the game shows output for a given input within 0.5 seconds
	Technique: Observe that output is perceived as 'immediate' after a given input.
	
	Test objective: Verify the game uses less than 10 megabytes of main memory
	Technique: Use a system monitor to check memory usage of the application.

Function Testing:

	Test objective: At game start, two '1' tiles are present on the game board.
	Technique: Start application. Observe game board for two 1 tiles.
	
	Test objective: Verify that there are four possible direction the board can  tilt; up, down, left and right.
	Technique: Start application. Check the the program accepts input 'u'p, 'd'own, 'l'eft and 'r'ight on different turns.
	
	Test objective: Verify that an empty input will result in a move forfeit, and add a tile to the board.
	Technique: Start application. Press enter for input. Verify that an additional tile appears on the screen.
	
	Test objective: Ensure that after each valid input (tilt of the board), the game board is printed again.
	Technique: Start application. tilt the board in each of the valid directions, checking at each stage that the board is printed again.
	
	Test objective: After each time the board is shown, user input is requested for the direction to tilt the board.
	Technique: Start application. Check for request for input. Input a valid direction. Check for request for input. Repeat 30 times.
	
	Test objective: Verify that when two of the same numbers tilt into each other, they are merged into one unit, and that unit is the sum of the two units.
	Technique: Start application. Position two tiles to be on the first row. tilt board left. Check the tiles have merged. Position two tiles on the same row, and tilt board right. Repeat for all rows. Repeat for all columns where row is replaced by column.
	
	Test objective: Verify that when the game board is full of numbers, the game prints out a game over message and exits.
	Technique: Start application. Fill the board with numbers by sliding the board inefficiently, or get your grandmother to play. Check that the game ends when the board is full of numbers.

	Test objective: Verify that invalid input results in a reprint of the game board and a prompt for valid input, with not change in the game board.
	Technique: Start application. Enter a variety of invalid inputs, verifying that each does not result in a change in the game board itself.
